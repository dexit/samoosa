# Mondai
The pluggable issue tracker

## What is it?
It's a client-side issue tracking UI with a pluggable backbone.

## Pluggable?
Mondai can be set up to work with GitHub, Bitbucket, your own custom backend, you name it. The support is added through plugins that reshape the content of their API sources into the Mondai format. In the case of the GitHub plugin, labels are being used to track version numbers, estimates, issue types and columns.
