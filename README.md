# Samoosa
A free and open-source issue tracker frontend

## Made to connect with any service
Samoosa can be set up to work with GitHub, Bitbucket, your own custom backend, you name it. The support is added through plugins that reshape the content of their API sources into the Mondai format. In the case of the GitHub plugin, labels are being used to track version numbers, estimates, issue types and columns.

## Entirely client-side
No server software, such as Node.js or PHP, is needed to run Samoosa. It's built entirely in client-side JavaScript.

## Steadily growing feature set
Samoosa has the basics covered, but is constantly being expanded with more features

### Current features
- Milestone planning
- Kanban board with customisable columns
- Project picker
- Customisable issue types, priorities, versions and estimates
- Printed pages for formal purposes such as scope-of-work documents

### Features to come
- BitBucket integration
- Issue burndown chart
